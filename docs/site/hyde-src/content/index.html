If you're new to sec-wall you may wish to follow the
[Getting started tutorial](/documentation/getting-started/index.html) which includes downloading the
software, installing it and preparing the first security configuration.

sec-wall supports
[SSL/TLS termination](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#option-ssl-wrap-only), 
[client certificates](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#client-certs), 
[WS-Security](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#ws-security),
[HTTP Basic Auth](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#basic-auth)/[Digest Auth](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#digest-auth),
extensible authentication
&amp; authorization schemes based on
[custom HTTP headers](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#custom-http) and
[XPath](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#xpath) expressions, powerful
[URL matching/rewriting](/documentation/ref-docs/url-rewrite.html) and an optional 
[headers enrichment](/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#headers-enrichment).
It's a security wall you can conveniently fence the otherwise defenseless backend servers with.

Although best suited for securing middleware and backend application
servers, sec-wall can be used anywhere the ubiquitous HTTP protocol is being used.
