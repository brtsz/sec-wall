<h1>Logging</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

There are several layers of logging employed by sec-wall. Proper understanding
of all of them is essential for mastering sec-wall yet not all of them will come
in handy in day-to-day work - some of them are rarely needed, for instance, only
when you're to deal with misbehaving proxy instances, others - like the log of
requests passing through a proxy - will be used more frequently.

What gets logged where and why stems directly from
[how sec-wall has been designed](/documentation/arch/index.html)
and the sketch diagram below captures the flow of information that controls the logging process.
Note that all paths are relative to
[the config.py file](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html).

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/media/gfx/logging.png" alt=""/>
</div>

You'll remember that
[sec-wall runs under a control of zdaemon](/documentation/arch/index.html), that's
why when the proxy is starting or stopping, there's a log entry being written
to the ./zdaemon.log file, basically the information which process is that of sec-wall
and that it has just started or stopped.

An unhandled error while processing an incoming client requests is always wrapped
in an HTTP 500 error and any information that might aid with resolving
the issue is being written to the ./logs/proxy.log file.

If config.py says that
[add_invocation_id](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#add_invocation_id)
and
[sign_invocation_id](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#sign_invocation_id)
are in effect, the necessary HTTP headers are created. Their format is documented
in [a separate section](#http-headers).

The regular log entries - showing what applications were accessing sec-wall, when it was,
whether they succeeded or not and [similar things](#log-entries) - are being written to
[syslog by default](#log-entries-configure)
and their format
is documented
in
[a separate section](#log-entries).
Whether they're written at all though depends on
[the log level configured](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#log_level).
They're emitted on either INFO or ERROR level so if you change the log level to,
say, CRITICAL, you'll never have any regular log messages written to the logs.

<h2 id="http-headers">HTTP headers</h2>
<h4 id="http-headers-default">Default configuration</h4>
The default configuration is governed by the config.py-wide variables:
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#add_invocation_id">add_invocation_id</a>
and
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#sign_invocation_id">sign_invocation_id</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

<h4 id="http-headers-configure">Configuring HTTP headers</h4>

Visit the sections about
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#add_invocation_id">add_invocation_id</a>
and
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#sign_invocation_id">sign_invocation_id</a>
variables for information on how to influence when the invocation ID-related headers
are being added.
<br/>
<br/>

<h4 id="http-headers-format">The headers format</h4>

An invocation ID is a string that uniquely identifies the given exchange of data
between a client application and a sec-wall instance. As long as
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#INSTANCE_UNIQUE">the INSTANCE_UNIQUE variable</a>
actually stays unique, the ID will be unique.
<br/><br/>

The exact formula for creating the <b>X-sec-wall-invocation-id</b> HTTP header is:
<br/><br/>

separator = '/'
<br/>
msg_number = msg_counter.next()
<br/>
invocation_id = <a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#instance_name">instance_name</a>
    + separator + <a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#INSTANCE_UNIQUE">INSTANCE_UNIQUE</a> + separator + msg_number

<br/><br/>

where <i>msg_counter</i> is an
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.count">itertools.count</a>
<img src="/media/gfx/external-link.png" alt="" /> instance, starting with 1,
recycled on each sec-wall's restart.

<br/><br/>

<h2 id="log-entries">Log entries</h2>

Each client's accessing a sec-wall instance ends in a log entry being emitted
to the logs. The log entries constitute both an access and an error log in the
sense that they're being written regardless of the HTTP response code, be it
2xx, 4xx, 5xx or any other.

<h4 id="log-entries-default">Default configuration</h4>

By default, if you haven't changed anything yet, sec-wall will be using local
syslog. The messages will be written to
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_address">/dev/syslog</a>
using the
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_facility">LOG_USER</a>
facility. Each message will be on either INFO or ERROR level which means that
all of the messages will land in syslog because the default
log level is
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#log_level">INFO</a>.

Depending on your syslog's configuration, the entries will by default probably
end up being written somewhere to /var/log, on Ubuntu it will be
the /var/log/messages file.

<h4 id="log-entries-configure">Configuring log entries</h4>

Changing the configuration may mean modifying the information about where syslog
is to be found, changing the log level or making sec-wall stop using syslog at all
in favour of any of
[the logging facilities Python supports](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
.

Use
[syslog_address](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_address)
and
[syslog_facility](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_facility)
variables to change the sec-wall's syslog-related configuration, for instance, to have a
sec-wall instance log to a remote syslog daemon.

Changing
[the log level](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#log_level)
a sec-wall proxy is running on influences a couple of
things. Firstly, it dictates how many entries will be written to logs. The other
thing is, the amount of things written in a single entry may be configured.

A running proxy emits entries on either INFO or ERROR level. INFO is reserved
for HTTP conversations that end in a successful authentication, that is, the client
application had supplied the expected credentials and was let in. Any other situations
will result in an ERROR entry being emitted to the logs.

You can change the log level to ERROR if you'd like to be shown only erratic situations.
Changing the log level in the other direction, to the DEBUG level, means a single
log entry will contain more [details](#log-entries-format). Note that the details
will also be added if the client hasn't been allowed in, when the incoming request
has been rejected.

One can always use
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#log_file_config">log_file_config</a>
for completely overriding where entries are written to. You can use for configuring
it to anything Python itself allows, including auto-rotated files, SMTP, queues
and many more. Note that <a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#log_file_config">log_file_config</a>
has priority over the default syslog configuration so whatever
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_address">syslog_address</a> and
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html#syslog_facility">syslog_facility</a>
have been set to will be ignored.

<h4 id="log-entries-format">The log entry format</h4>

A single log entry consists of either 10 or 16 semicolon-separated fields -
<a href="#log-entries-configure">the exact number depends on whether the details shouldn't or should be logged</a>
in addition to the basic data. Note that a field may always be empty if there was no way
to establish its proper vaule.

Here are some clickable examples of both short and long log entries. They're broken
out into several lines but each entry is actually emitted as a single line.

<div style="text-align:left">

The table below lists all the fields along with their description. Note that
fields are 0-indexed. Again, fields 0-9 are the basic data and 10-15 are
