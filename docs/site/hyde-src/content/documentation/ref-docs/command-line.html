<h1>sec-wall, the command-line tool</h1>

{% markdown %}

Upon completing the
[installation](/documentation/getting-started/index.html), you'll be able to make use
of the sec-wall command. It's the only tool for administering sec-wall instances
and it's usually installed to /usr/bin/sec-wall on Linux so you should have no problems
with finding it on your system.

There are 3 things the command is used for:

* [Initializing a directory for sec-wall's use](#init)
* [Starting a proxy](#start)
* [Stopping a proxy](#stop)

<h2 id="init">Initializing a directory for sec-wall's use</h2>

{% syntax bash %}
$ sec-wall --init /path/to/an/empty/directory
{% endsyntax %}

Initializes an empty directory to store the sec-wall's data. The directory must
exist and must be empty, an error will be returned otherwise. A default
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html">config file</a>
and a directory for holding
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/logging.html">error log entries</a>
will be created on a successful
execution. The initialization process will mark the directory as containing
a sec-wall's instance configuration data by placing an empty
*.sec-wall-config* file in there.

<h2 id="start">Starting the proxy</h2>


{% syntax bash %}
$ sec-wall --start /path/to/an/already/initialized/sec-wall/directory
{% endsyntax %}

Starts a sec-wall instance whose configuration data must've been already made
available in the directory pointed to by the command line's only argument. An
error will be returned if the directory doesn't seem to be belonging to sec-wall.

The proxy is started in the background and there's no need for using *nohup*
or similar tools. Likewise, if started successfully the proxy never writes directly to
stdout or stderr.

A running proxy is under control of [zdaemon](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zdaemon/) ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png),
a deamon control library, which means it will be automatically respawned should
it ever shut down due to an unhandled internal error of any sort.

<h2 id="stop">Stopping the proxy</h2>

{% syntax bash %}
$ sec-wall --stop /path/to/a/directory/holding/a/running/sec-wall/instance/data
{% endsyntax %}

Stops a running proxy. An error will be returned if the proxy hasn't been previously
started in the given directory. An error message will also be shown if the directory
doesn't seem to be owned by a sec-wall's instance.
