<h1>URL rewriting</h1>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

sec-wall has support for changing the URLs on fly, that is, the URL a client
application is accessing doesn't necessarily have to map 1:1 to what a backend
server exposes, there's always an option of sec-wall's adjusting it to your needs.

You doubtless remember that
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html#url-patterns">parts of the URLs to be matched need to be <i>named</i></a>
and the names can be used for constructing new URLs, like in this example:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/gfx/url-rewrite.png" alt="" />
</div>

That is, it's possible to state that a pattern of the URL the client application
invokes - such as <b>/before/\<customer_id:int\>/profile/\<customer_name:unicode\>/</b>
gets mapped into a backend server's <b>/after/{customer_id}/cust-profile/{customer_name}/</b>
pattern. Hence in runtime, a client application's invoking the <b>/before/2816917/profile/Flann O'Brien/</b>
URL will result in sec-wall's invoking the backend's URL of <b>/after/2816917/cust-profile/Flann O'Brien/</b> -
in other words, the names matched may be put between curly bracket to help form new URLs.

The complete configuration, one that should be added to
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html">the config.py file</a>,
might look like the one below, the key is to use the <b>rewrite</b> option of
a given URL's configuration dictionary.

{% syntax python %}
def url_rewrite_sample():
    return {
        'custom-http': True,
        'custom-http-Accept-Language':'en-us,en;q=0.5',
        'host': 'http://example.com/',
        'rewrite': '/after/{customer_id}/cust-profile/{customer_name}/'
    }

urls = [
    ('/before/<customer_id:int>/profile/<customer_name:unicode>/', url_rewrite_sample()),
]
{% endsyntax %}

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

There's [a whole chapter devoted to nothing but showing various examples of sec-wall's configuration files](/documentation/usage-examples/index.html),
head over there for more information.
