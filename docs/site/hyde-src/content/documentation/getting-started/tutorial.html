<h1>Getting started tutorial</h1>

{% markdown %}

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a simple configuration file
designed for securing a backend server and we'll make it require
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" title="(external link) HTTP Basic Authentication on Wikipedia">HTTP Basic Authentication</a>
<img src="/media/gfx/external-link.png" alt="" /> .
We'll be doing it from scratch, with no previous experience with sec-wall assumed.

The only thing you need to make sure of is that <a href="/documentation/getting-started/index.html" title="The installation guide">sec-wall has already been
installed</a> and it's ready to use. If you're not sure if sec-wall's already installed,
you can simply type *sec-wall* in the command line shell and any response similar
to the one below means you're good to go. Head over to <a href="/documentation/getting-started/index.html">the installation guide</a>
if it seems the sec-wall package has not been installed on your system yet.

{% syntax bash %}

$ sec-wall
usage: sec-wall [-h] (--init INIT | --start START | --stop STOP)
sec-wall: error: one of the arguments --init --start --stop is required
$

{% endsyntax %}
{% endmarkdown %}

The process of securing servers is always carried out in several simple steps:

1. Initializing the security proxy in an empty directory,
2. Updating the automatically generated config file with the changes needed for
   securing a particular URL,
3. Starting the proxy,
4. (optionally) Stopping the proxy and jumping to the point 2. above

<h2 id="init">Initializing the proxy</h2>

To initialize the proxy, you need to create an empty directory and then invoke
the sec-wall command so that it prepares the template config file and marks the
directory as belonging to sec-wall:

{% syntax bash %}

$ mkdir /path/to/my-proxy
$ sec-wall --init /path/to/my-proxy

{% endsyntax %}

That's all there is to that step, you only need to sure that the directory the
--init switch is pointing to is really empty, an error message will be shown if
there are any files or subdirectories inside.

{% endmarkdown %}
<br/>
{% markdown %}


<h2 id="config">Understanding the auto-generated config file</h2>

If you browse into the newly created directory (/path/to/my-proxy above) you'll notice
a *config.py* file which is the central place for configuring sec-wall, that's
where the most of the action happens and it's the file you'll be spending the most time with
while working with sec-wall so let's dissect one to make sure it hides no surprises
to anyone:

{% syntax python %}
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# stdlib
import os.path as path, uuid

# Don't share it with anyone.
INSTANCE_SECRET = 'af192106065d424baa391e5c77dc66ab'

# May be shared with the outside world.
INSTANCE_UNIQUE = uuid.uuid4().hex

# Useful constants
cur_dir = path.dirname(__file__)

# Crypto
keyfile = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/server-priv.pem')
certfile = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/server-cert.pem')
ca_certs = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/ca-cert.pem')

# ##############################################################################

def default():
    return {
        'ssl': True,
        'ssl-cert': True,
        'ssl-cert-commonName':INSTANCE_SECRET,
        'host': 'http://' + INSTANCE_SECRET
    }

urls = [
    ('/*', default()),
]
{% endsyntax %}

That's how a default config file looks like, it's a regular Python source code file
and it may broken out into two sections.

What goes above the comment line should
rarely be changed, if ever - it's a mostly static configuration, things like UUIDs
needed for cryptographically signing the headers off (note the INSTANCE_SECRET
one and just like the comment says, never show that UUID to anyone), or things
like paths to SSL material.

The part below the comment line is where the actual configuration goes. There's
a *url* object (a variable) which is a list of two-element tuples. The first element
is a URL pattern to be secured and the second element is the configuration dictionary
governing the security. In the default case, sec-wall's configuration basically forbids access
to any URLs, to any resources, with a configuration which says that the requesting
application should be using a client certificate, and that certificate's commonName
field should be equal to that sec-wall instance's INSTANCE_SECRET UUID. In other
words, by default, as long as you keep INSTANCE_SECRET for yourself there's no chance someone
will pass through the proxy.

<h2 id="updates">Making updates to the config file</h2>

OK, we know that by default sec-wall won't allow anyone in so why don't we let
a client in now with sec-wall requesting the client to use HTTP Basic Authentication.
For the purpose of this tutorial we'll be using a username of "foo" and the
password "bar". The URL to be secured will be of the
/account/\<account_name:unicode\> pattern, that is, there will be an /account prefix
followed by any string and any other URL will be picked up by the default pattern.
/account/hey-joe and /account/123456 will match the config while /my/settings/hey-joe
will not. We'll be proxying the requests over to the  <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> domain in this particular case.
Assigning labels to chosen parts of a URL ('account_name' here) is useful when a URL
rewrite is needed - it won't be used in the tutorial but it's good to know that
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/url-rewrite.html">it's possible to rewrite the URLs with sec-wall</a>.

The whole configuration file should now read like below:

{% syntax python %}
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# stdlib
import os.path as path, uuid

# Don't share it with anyone.
INSTANCE_SECRET = 'af192106065d424baa391e5c77dc66ab'

# May be shared with the outside world.
INSTANCE_UNIQUE = uuid.uuid4().hex

# Useful constants
cur_dir = path.dirname(__file__)

# Crypto
keyfile = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/server-priv.pem')
certfile = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/server-cert.pem')
ca_certs = path.join(cur_dir, './crypto/ca-cert.pem')

# ##############################################################################

def default():
    return {
        'ssl': True,
        'ssl-cert': True,
        'ssl-cert-commonName':INSTANCE_SECRET,
        'host': 'http://' + INSTANCE_SECRET
    }

def tutorial():
    return {
        'basic-auth':True,
        'basic-auth-realm': 'sec-wall tutorial',
        'basic-auth-username': 'foo',
        'basic-auth-password': 'bar',
        'host': 'http://example.com'
    }

urls = [
    ('/account/<account_name:unicode>', tutorial()),
    ('/*', default()),
]
{% endsyntax %}

Assigning True to the 'basic-auth' key suffices for sec-wall to understand that
an HTTP Basic Auth is to be used for the given URL. Consequently, sec-wall requires
us to provide it with three other keywords required for a proper functioning of
that scheme, these are 'basic-auth-realm', 'basic-auth-username' and
'basic-auth-password' (note that the password is stored in clear text). The 'host'
key obviously points to the name of the target domain, the one that should receive
the requests.

Note that the order of URL patterns does matter. In run-time, the first match
will always win and will take precedence over any subsequent patterns that could've
possibly also matched the given URL. That's why the catch-all <strong>'/*'</strong> pattern has
been added at the end, so that it doesn't hijack all the requests regardless
of our intent.

That's exactly what's needed for configuring sec-wall. Regardless of the
authentication & authorization scheme, you simply need to choose a URL pattern
and assign a dictionary of options to that pattern. All the possible
<a href="/documentation/ref-docs/sec-config.html">options are listed and explained in the reference documentation</a>.

Note the flexibility that comes with the approach of assigning options to URL patterns -
although it's a simple tutorial only and we won't be doing it, there's absolutely
nothing preventing us from reusing the same options throughout more than one URL
pattern so that the options can be specified once only and be used in multiple places.
Not only that! Given that they're really pure-Python dictionaries, the options
can be read from virtually everywhere. As far as sec-wall is concerned, they must
be dictionaries, but sec-wall isn't really interested in whether they're really stored
in the same config file, in separate modules, SQL databases, LDAP or wherever your
environment dictates they should be fetched from. All sec-wall is caring about is
whether the *urls* objects of the config.py module contains a tuple of patterns
and config options, how they are to materialize there is completely transparent
to sec-wall.

Let's proceed to starting the proxy now.

<h2 id="start">Starting the proxy</h2>

The command below will start the proxy:

{% syntax bash %}

$ sec-wall --start /path/to/my-proxy

{% endsyntax %}

That is, there's a *--start* switch that accepts a single parameter, the directory
a sec-wall instance has been previously initialized in using the *--init* option.

The proxy is started in background and you don't have to resort to creating your
own [nohup][nohup] <img src="/media/gfx/external-link.png" alt="" /> wrappers for sec-wall,
it's all there out of the box.

Fire up your favourite web browser now and open the [http://localhost:15100/account/hey-there][localhost]
URL, 15100 is the default port sec-wall is listening on but as just about anything
it can also be customized. You will be prompted for a username and a password ('foo' and 'bar' respectively,
remember?) and upon entering the credentials you'll be greeted with the content
fetched by sec-wall from the remote site and delivered to your browser, in other
words, the security proxy will have worked fine. Now open an invalid URL, such as
[http://localhost:15100/invalid/blog/page/1][invalid] and witness the
"You are not allowed to access this resource" message along with an appropriate
HTTP 403 Forbidden status - just as it was promised, opening any URL that matches
the default configuration means the client request - your browser's in that case -
will be rejected.

<h2 id="stop">Stopping the proxy</h2>

Appropriately enough, the option *--stop* of the sec-wall command is used for
stopping the proxy, just like below:

{% syntax bash %}

$ sec-wall --stop /path/to/my-proxy

{% endsyntax %}

You just give it a path to the directory containing a sec-wall instance and it will
gracefully stop it.

<h2 id="summing-up">Summing it all up and what's next</h2>

So that's how the life cycle looks like, first the proxy needs to be initialized,
and don't forget that sec-wall needs an empty directory for it. The auto-generated file needs to be
modified by you and then the proxy can be started and stopped as needed.

Of course, that's only a quick tutorial meant to get you quickly started and
it doesn't cover that much of what sec-wall has to offer. There's still [SSL/TLS][ssltls],
[WS-Security][wsse], [HTTP Auth Digest][auth_digest], [custom HTTP headers][custom_headers]
[XPath expressions][xpath], [URL matching/rewriting][matching_rewriting] and
the option of [enriching the headers][enrichment]. If there's anything
missing in sec-wall and you'd like to see it be added in future releases, please
don't hesitate to have a look at the [support page][support]. See you there!
