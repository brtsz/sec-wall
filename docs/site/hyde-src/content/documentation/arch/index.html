<h1>Architecture <span class="amp">&amp;</span> design notes</h1>

{% markdown %}

**sec-wall** is a software for securing access to other software.
It grew out of the necessity of securing big, proprietary and clumsy application servers that were
exposing HTTP services (mostly [SOAP][soap] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png))
to
surrounding application servers deployed in a diverse mix of Linux,
Windows, proprietary UNIX and mainframe systems, all of that running in a closed, internal
[SOA][soa] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) environment.
Original design requirements for sec-wall included:

* performance allowing for up to several thousand short-lived connections and requests a second
  under a virtualized system running on top of a basic [Blade server][blade] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png),
  any throughput beyond it would be considered a plus,
* support for a wide range of authentication &amp; authorization options,
* complete transparency regardless of whether the client and backend applications
  are written in Java, .NET, Python, PHP, COBOL, C++ or any other technology,
* user interface friendly for people familiar with general Linux administration,
* support for plugging in various sources of authentication &amp; authorization data,
  that is, sec-wall by itself shouldn't limit the users in a choice of a database of users, passwords
  and other relevant information; on the other hand, there shouldn't be
  any requirement that there be any external database at all, the configuration
  should as well be expressible directly in the sec-wall's config file,
* ability to run on Linux x86 and z/Linux,
* should be written in Python

* * *

The requirement for serving many connections on simple servers ruled out solutions
based on multithreading or multiprocessing and left the author with the only
choice that didn't sound like locking oneself up in a concrete approach to handling
concurrency, the choice was to use [libevent][libevent] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png). Because the application
was to be written in Python, [gevent][gevent] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png), a highly Pythonic
wrapper was chosen as a layer for exposing libevent's features to sec-wall. Another
compelling reason was the gevent's monkey patching utility which allows for many
of the Python's standard library modules - such as [urllib2][urllib2] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) -
to essentially become asynchronous and cooperative with gevent's core. Apart from its pythonicity,
gevent's code is clean and easy to follow, which means an easier learning curve
should there ever be any need for contributing patches upstream. A contributing
factor for choosing both libevent and gevent was that even though there was no
need for supporting *BSD systems at the time sec-wall was originally created,
there shouldn't be any obstacles if people want to use sec-wall on those systems.

The drawing below explains the major processing paths. Command line tool initializes,
starts and stops an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. The proxy accepts client connections and if the
configuration says a client should be let in, the request is then proxied over
further to backend servers. An appropriate *Access denied* HTTP response is returned
to the calling application in case the configuration prohibits it from accessing
the requested resource.

The only user-facing command line tool is called *sec-wall*. It's a simple command
with only several options and that's the way it's intended to stay as the main
burden of configuring sec-wall should fall on a config file. The idea is that
getting lost in a myriad of command
line options has never been fun and sec-wall shouldn't encourage such designs.
Likewise, creating a separate command for each of the actions to perform would've been also a no-no.
The command line options are simple to the point of being dumb, *--init*, *--start*
and *--stop* accept a single and the same argument, so the purpose of those options
should be self-explanatory for people in a hurry.
Have a look at
[secwall.main][secwall.main] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
in the source code for details on how command line arguments are being parsed. Note that the *--fork* option is treated differently,
that's because it's not part of what regular users should see,
it would be tempting to simply add it to sec-wall the command but it was felt
that's not the way it should be, an internal detail should not be exposed in a
user's tool.

Once started, sec-wall is a long running process, a daemon. What the command line
options *--start* and *--stop* actually do is invoking a [zdaemon][zdaemon] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
command in a subprocess. *--start* creates a zdaemon.conf file and tells the zdaemon
process to start using it, zdaemon in turn runs the sec-wall's Python code, mediates
access to stdout &amp; stderr and automatically restarts sec-wall in case it's needed.
The *stop* option does the opposite, first tells zdaemon to stop the sec-wall's main
processing loop and, once it's stopped, it then removes the automatically generated zdaemon.conf
file so that the working directory is left at the state it was prior to running
the *--start* option save for any log files generated when sec-wall was up.
[secwall.cli][secwall.cli] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
is the place where the actual processing of command line options takes place;
note that a good deal of code belongs to the *secwall.cli._Command* base class which among
other things takes care of communicating with zdaemon through the zdaemon's UNIX
socket interface - that lets the subclasses focus on their business functionality.

As with any non-trivial software, sec-wall may be easily divided into major components,
the building blocks that cooperate to reach a desired effect. Those blocks are glued
together using [Spring Python's][spring-python] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) Inversion
of Control concept. What it means is that the parts become loosely coupled
and independent, that allows for easier testing and swapping the parts without
having to worry about breaking things due to intermingled dependencies between
various parts of the code. Apart from that, most of the interal sec-wall's configuration,
such as default error messages, are stored in the IoC context. The context
lives in [secwall.app_context][secwall.app_context] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png),
it's a regular Python file with one class, any methods adorned with an *@Object*
decorator become container-managed objects which basically means they will be invoked
when sec-wall's starting and their return value will be stored for a later re-use.
To repeat, the methods will be invoked once only at the very beggining and
their return values become singletons. Once stored in the cache, the objects
may then be easily fetched from the context.

Not all of the building blocks are under control of IoC, it seemed contrived
and uncalled for to squeeze things related to command line into IoC. What got
into IoC though was everything related to the run-time processing of
incoming requests.

The main sec-wall's parts are:

- command line handling code, introduced above, used for initializing config
  directories and starting/stopping proxies,
- secwall.server.HTTPProxy; the main class responsible for handling unencrypted
  plain HTTP traffic, a very thin wrapper around gevent.wsgi.WSGIServer, its
  main job is to fetch the *wsgi_request_app* object from the IoC context
  and pass the control to gevent,
- secwall.server.HTTPSProxy; the main class for handling encrypted SSL/TLS
  requests, also a thin wrapper around gevent's server but this time it's a subclass
  of gevent.pywsgi.WSGIServer; fetches the *wsgi_request_app* and *wsgi_request_handler* objects
  from the IoC context and passes the control to gevent. The HTTPS proxy allows
  a client to authenticate itself using a client certificate, however if a client
  doesn't have a certificate the connections are still accepted in the sense
  of starting an SSL/TLS session to the proxy - naturally it still means that
  if the security config says the client should have a certificate but it doesn't
  have one then the connection will be closed as soon as the main WSGI app's \__call\__
  method gets executed (explained below),
- secwall.server._RequestApp, known as *wsgi_request_app* in the IoC context;
  the [WSGI][wsgi] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) application
  whose \__call\__ method is executed on each accepted request. Note the *accepted*
  part, the fact that \__call\__ gets called means the client connection to a proxy
  has already been established, in particular, if it's an SSL/TLS connection it means
  we're already past the handshake and we're in a middle of an established SSL/TLS session.
  The method's logic is as follows:
    * If there's no configuration for *PATH_INFO*
      in the request (for instance, a client wishes to access /foo/bar/baz but the
      config says nothing about it), a 404 Not Found HTTP error is return to the caller,
    * Some quick SSL/TLS related checks are performed, in that order: a 403 Forbidden
      is returned if config says the given URL should be accessed through HTTPS only but
      regular HTTP has been used, a 401 Unauthorized is returned if client is required
      to use an SSL/TLS certificate but it sent none,
    * All supported validation methods are tried in the order given by the
      *validation_precedence* object of the IoC context, only the first method to
      match the configuration for the URL is being executed. If there's no matching
      method (for instance, when the configuration is invalid), a 500 Server Error
      is returned to the caller,
    * If, for any reason, the validation method says the client should not be allowed
      in, a 401 Unauthorized is returned to the calling application. Note that
      validation methods for Basic Auth, Digest Auth, custom HTTP headers,
      XPath expressions and SSL/TLS certificates are coded directly into _RequestApp whereas WSSE
      validation makes use of the secwall.wsse.WSSE class,
    * If the validation phase is successful, the URL is optionally being rewritten
      into a new one, if no *rewrite* config option exists, the URL for invoking
      the backend server is taken as-is from the client request.
    * What comes next is the first stage of the enrichment process, HTTP headers
      specified in the *from-client-ignore* config list
      are removed from the request and new headers, taken from the *to-backend-add*
      dictionary are added to the list of headers. If not configured otherwise,
      the authentication-related headers are first cryptographically signed and
      then the whole request is proxied to the backend server. A gevent's
      monkey-patched version of urllib2 is used for invoking far servers which means
      the code's not blocking the processing of other incoming requests.
      The response is a subject to the second phase of the enrichment,
      headers belonging to the *from-backend-ignore* list are being removed from
      the response and new ones, taken from the *to-client-add* dictionary
      are added. The response from the server is returned to the caller - note that
      all the auth-related headers mentioned above may also be returned to the caller.

- secwall.server._RequestHandler, known as *wsgi_request_handler* in IoC. A simple subclass
  of gevent.pywsgi.WSGIHandler which allows for secwall.server._RequestApp to optionally
  accept the SSL/TLS client certificates sent in by client applications. The class
  is a good candidate for a patch to gevent so it's quite possible that it will
  disappear in future versions of sec-wall,

- secwall.wsse.WSSE, implements the [UsernameToken Profile 1.0][username-token-profile-1.0] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
  part of the family of Web Services Security recommendations. The code has been
  written with re-usability in mind and can be easily used in other
  projects. Do note however that sec-wall currently **does not** maintain a cache
  of nounces used, though a subclass of the WSSE class might as well define one. Future
  versions of sec-wall may be able to improve the situation by using a cache
  based on [memcached][memcached] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) or on similar tools.

<hr />

sec-wall, the project, believes in good and an always up-to-date documentation. Things
along the lines of *"we're short on documentation at the moment but in the meantime
you can always browse the source code"* are outright rejected and simply have
no place in this project. Of course, everyone's invited to have a look at the source
code, it's open-source after all, but that in no way may be an excuse for not
having a decent documentation. Same goes for docstrings; every class, function
and method  - except for magical methods such as \__init\__ or \__repr\__  -
must have a clear explanation of its purpose.

It's very important that the project's web page which holds the documentation
be acccessible to anyone, including people with impairments. The project will
strive to achieve the highest possible conformance with the
latest version of the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines][wcag20] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) and with
other similar industry standards and recommendations. Any suggestions for the better
implementation in that regards are always very much welcome.

Any requests from users to update or improve the documentation will be treated
with great care; any omissions, ambiguities or typos will have a status of
regular functional bugs. In short, documentation is just as much a part of the
project as the business functionality and test cases are.

The website has been built using [Hyde][hyde] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png), a static website generator written
in Python on top of [Django][django] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) and a dozen of other libraries. Most of the website's
content is written using the [markdown][markdown] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) markup, the rest is regular HTML
used in places such as div layouts. The website is very simple and focused
on the actual content instead of bells and whistles so it shouldn't be very hard
to keep its current [XHTML 1.0 Strict][xhtml] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) compatibility while keeping in mind that
at some point it should be ported to [HTML 5.0][html50] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png).

<hr />

sec-wall is a security software and as any piece of software, but as a security related
one in particular, it deserves to be thoroughly tested before making any stable releases
thus it should be no surprise that in terms of source lines of code there are more
test cases then there is the actual business functionality. The project also uses
[coverage.py][coverage] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png) to keep a 100% code coverage for ensuring that there's
no unnecessary code, that is, it can be assumed that a line of code may be safely removed if there isn't any
test case to cover it unless there are very good reasons for not testing the line
in question. For instance, wsse.server._RequestHandler is a subclass of
gevent.pywsgi.WSGIHandler that reimplements the *handle_one_response* method by adding
a couple of its own lines. In this particular situation it would be an overkill
to test all the not so trivial branches of the overridden method, tests only cover
those lines that are directly related to what's been added by sec-wall, the rest has been
excluded from influencing the line coverage machinery by adding a *# pragma: no cover* comment.
It is the project's practice that any particular commit made to the [trunk branch][sec-wall-trunk] ![](/media/gfx/external-link.png)
is guaranteed to be fully tested but the same doesn't apply to feature or private
branches created, for instance, to resolve a particular bug.

There are many 3rd party libraries used for testing and there isn't any particular
inclination towards, for example, a "favourite" or "the best" one for mocking up the classes
under tests, if something does its job well, is easy to use and there isn't anything
similar in use already, then it should be added as a new project's dependency.

Contrary to the direction of some projects, there should be no thinking twice
about designing the sec-wall's APIs with tests in mind. It stems from the author
opinion that there's really no distinction between 'the code' and 'the tests',
it's all code, the line should rather be drawn in terms of 'the business functionality'
and 'the tests', all under the 'code' term. So if changing an API  - slightly and
without making it weird all of a sudden - should help with implementing the tests
then that's what should be done.
